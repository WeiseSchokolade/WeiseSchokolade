### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I've been developing software since 2021 but my journey with computers and logic started way before that.
Java was the language that started my programming journey, and it's my preferred language to this day.
Other programming languages I've used include Python, JavaScript, MCFunction, C++, Scratch and Kotlin.
My code is neither the best nor the most efficient. If you have suggestions how to improve it, feel free to share them!

Some Projects I'm proud of are:
- [RRSWJ](https://github.com/WeiseSchokolade/RRSWJ) - A library/framework for games and similar applications
- [My Website](https://weiseschokolade.github.io/)
- [Vocabulary](https://github.com/WeiseSchokolade/Vocabulary) - A software for practicing vocabulary
- [NotGustavo'sButterChicken](https://github.com/WeiseSchokolade/NotGustavosButterChicken) - A contribution to Jame Gam #25. In retrospect, the code and the game design aren't that good though.

I am really bad at thinking of names for projects.
Really "creative" names I came up with:
- [Saving](https://github.com/WeiseSchokolade/saving)
- [Vocabulary](https://github.com/WeiseSchokolade/Vocabulary)
